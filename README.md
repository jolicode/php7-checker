# php7-checker

php7-checker is a PHP library that parses your code and statically detects
some errors that could prevent it to run on PHP7.

*Disclamer*: this tool is a static analyzer. As it doesn't run your code it's
far from being 100% reliable. If you need to ensure that some code will run on
PHP 7, nothing will do a better job than a complete test suite run on the
targeted version of PHP. If you want to test it locally (f.e. because your code
is not open source), you can still have a look to
[JoliCi](https://github.com/jolicode/JoliCi).
